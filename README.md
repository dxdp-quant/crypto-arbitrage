### Prerequisites

Some of the information about the market and assets should be provided before launching the program.

The information is splitted into two parts : `public.yaml` and `private.yaml`.

The publicly opened information is stored in `info/public.yaml`, which you may want to modify when the information is updated later.

The private matter must be stored in `info/secret.yaml`. Write up the file by referring `info/secret.yaml.template` as a template file.
